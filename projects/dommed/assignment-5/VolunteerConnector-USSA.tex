\section{Meeting Report}
This week, our group met twice, once on Thursday and once on Sunday, to go plan our
project and complete tasks. We met with the customer and went over user stories. We split
the tasks up between the developers, prioritized sections of the website, and made a
tentative schedule for deadlines for each feature. Sequence diagrams were made for each of
the user stories that we plan on implementing by next week. All of the tasks seem
reasonable, and we should be able to accomplish all tasks in the time allotted.

For next week, we plan on coding some of the basics of the website. This includes the home
page and accounts along with account type functionality. The team plans on meeting on
Monday and Thursday of next week to start coding of the website.
