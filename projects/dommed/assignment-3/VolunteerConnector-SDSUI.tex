\section{Meeting Report}
Our group met twice for this portion of the project. The first meeting was on 1 February
2018 where we outlined the final functionalities of the website. We also chose to use
node.js instead of PHP to run the site. Furthermore, the design and layout of the
website was discussed and started. On the second meeting, we discussed more design options
and put the Software Design Specification and User Interface together for turn in. For
both meetings, the customer was present and provided design input. The rest of this week,
we plan to work on fleshing out the finer details of the design of the website and the
user interface.
